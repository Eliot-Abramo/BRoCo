This folder contains the files used to simulate the RoCo communication network between the Control Station and the different components of the rover. 

There are two subnetworks,
- one where the CS communicates to the Avionics (and vice-versa) via the Jetson (which is the server of the network) (5GHz link) and 
- one where the CS communcicates to the Power Supply (and vice-versa) directly (2.4GHz link). The power supply is the server.
